## Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript

- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Use `const` and `let`, avoid `var`
- Use async/await over callbacks
- Add JSDoc comments for functions

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Extracts slide data from the page
 * @param {number} timeout - Maximum wait time in ms
 * @returns {Promise<Array>} Array of slide objects
 */
async function extractSlideData(timeout = 5000) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Naming Conventions

- Functions: camelCase (`extractSlideData`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_RETRIES`)
- Classes: PascalCase (`SlideConverter`)
- Files: kebab-case (`service-worker.js`)
